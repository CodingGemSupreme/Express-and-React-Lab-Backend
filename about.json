    "bio": "Hi, I'm Oma. I am a software engineer with experience in entrepreneurship, coaching, content creation, problem solving, and marketing. I am also a student at the esteemed educational institution General Assembly. As a person I am an outgoing, collaborative, and energetic individual who enjoys a good laugh or two. Some technologies I am currently learning/using are node.js, JavaScript, Mongo DB, EJS, RESTful Routing, JSON, HTML 5, and CSS 3, React, Django, Jquery, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Bulma, and PostgreSQL. My work experience includes retail sales, management, recruiting, branding, e-mail/social media/grassroots marketing, and banking. After working in these fields I was able to identify an opportunity for end users to get better usage of the digital products we've come to enjoy in this day and age. I also enjoy updating and debugging too. At the core of who I am there is a problem solver that loves to bring ease of use and joy to stakeholders and the end users who will drive the growth and usage of the many things we create as developers/engineers."
